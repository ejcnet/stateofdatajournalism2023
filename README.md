## Data

The State of Data Journalism 2022 Survey comprises a total of 73 questions and had 776 respondents, of which we used 768 for the analysis. The survey ranges in content from demographics to characteristics, skills and tool use, location, publication mediums, scope and beat, to name a few. 

The here publicised dataset does not fully reflect the raw data resulting from the survey in the aim to protect the privacy of respondents. The survey was presented as anonymous to begin with, but optional participation in a raffle meant the submission of name and email from a subset of respondents. 

These fields, as well as other fields that could have allowed deanonymisation (company of work, previous participation in the survey, membership in associations, income), have been removed.

## Survey

The survey was open between December 7th, 2023 and January 16th, 2024. Participation was encouraged through direct mailing, social media promotion, and asking the DataJournalism.com and European Journalism Centre network of contacts for help in spreading the word. Targeted respondents include full and part time employed data journalists, as well as freelancers; data editors and team leads; trainers, faculty members and educators; students. 

The survey scope was global. Respondents were asked questions about their demographics, the skills possessed and the tools used for work, the work practices, the challenges and opportunities related to work, and the impact of the pandemic on their work. 

To minimise survey length while maximising survey inclusion, questions targeting a specific subgroup were only shown to those respondents, but questions about journalistic practices were left open to all (this to reflect that students, educators, and editors might be involved in producing and publishing data journalisitic work from time to time). Only a selected number of questions were mandatory.
